# InteractiveWebGraphics
Project 4 for IGME230

## Proposal
I have created an interactive landscape that begins with a main page containing three main clickable elements â€“ a worm, a tree, and flowers. When a user clicks on one of the three elements, it will bring them to a new page, and when a user hovers over each of the elements, they change color to indicate interactivity. All pages use the .animate function of Snap.SVG to animate the graphics. The worm and flower page both focus on the graphics moving in and out of the screen when an element is clicked on (clickable element is indicated through the elements color change upon hover). The tree page contains draggable apples and, when the trunk is clicked, the apples use .animate to return to their original position on the tree. Each page contains a home button to return back to the main index page, and all documentation can be achieved by clicking the documentation cloud on the index page. All content has been created by me using Snap.SVG unless otherwise stated in documentation.
